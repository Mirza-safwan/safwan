        <h2>The Thinker of Pakistan</h2>
        <p>Allama Muhammad Iqbal, also known as the “Poet of the East,” was an important philosopher, poet, and thinker. He was born on November 9, 1877, in Sialkot, Punjab, which was then part of British India (now in Pakistan). Iqbal’s life was full of knowledge and love for his people.

            Iqbal’s education started at home, where he learned Persian and Arabic. Later, he went to Scottish Mission School and then studied at Government College University in Lahore. He also studied in Europe, where he went to universities in Germany and England to learn philosophy and law.
            
            Iqbal is best known for his amazing poetry, which was written in Persian. His poems were full of deep thoughts and ideas. They talked about self-respect, justice, and the importance of faith. His famous works include “Asrar-e-Khudi” (Secrets of the Self), “Rumuz-e-Bekhudi” (Mysteries of Selflessness), and “Shikwa” (Complaint). These poems discussed important topics like the meaning of life, the role of faith, and how to live a good life.
            
            Iqbal’s poetry mixes philosophy, mysticism, and political ideas. He used beautiful Persian poetry styles, like ghazals and masnavis, to express his thoughts. His poems are full of symbols and deep meanings, which made them powerful and inspiring.
            
            One of Iqbal’s most important ideas was the vision of a united and independent Muslim state. His thoughts helped in the creation of Pakistan, a country where many people shared his dreams. Iqbal’s ideas had a huge impact on the history of the subcontinent and led to many changes in the region.
            
            Iqbal’s influence goes beyond just his poetry. He is remembered as one of the greatest thinkers in the Muslim world. His ideas about believing in yourself, caring for society, and always learning new things continue to inspire people. His poems still touch the hearts of readers worldwide, offering wisdom on life and the challenges of today’s world.
            
            In conclusion, Allama Iqbal was a great visionary whose poetry and thoughts continue to inspire people. His writings, full of philosophy, mysticism, and political ideas, are a source of motivation for anyone looking for a better and brighter future.
